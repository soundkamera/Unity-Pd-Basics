# UnityPdBasics
very bare bones starting point for Pd and Unity

This Unity project is made up of a handful of scenes that each show one aspect of a very basic implementation of Pd in Unity. 

This is all built on the LibPdIntegration project by Niall Moody https://github.com/LibPdIntegration/LibPdIntegration
and borrows heavily from Niall's LibPdIntegrationExamples project https://github.com/LibPdIntegration/LibPdIntegrationExamples

This project is even more stripped down than those, and also includes Prefab objects for different types of Pd sound implementation. This lets you drag and drop different types of sound into the scene.

Here is a playlist of short videos to accompany this repository. Have fun learning!

The current five videos are:
1. Adding libpd to your own Unity project
2. Playing an ambient sound in Unity using Pd
3. Spatializing a Pd patch
4. Sending a bang from Unity to Pd to trigger stuff
5. Sending a number value from Unity to Pd to control stuff
